💡 Training a neural network to predict the next word can be useful for auto-completion and text generation tasks.
📊 Importing necessary libraries like TensorFlow, NumPy, and NLTK is crucial for building the text generation AI.
🧩 Tokenizing the text helps in preprocessing and organizing the data for model training.
🔬 Training the model with the provided dataset helps in learning the patterns and predicting the next word accurately.
⌨️ Predicting the next word can be done by providing input words and choosing the most likely prediction using the trained model.
📝 The generated text may not always make sense due to limitations in the training data and model complexity.
🤔 Further improvements can be made by training the model on larger datasets and fine-tuning the architecture.
